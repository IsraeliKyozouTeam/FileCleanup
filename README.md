# FileCleanup
Repository for the FileCleanup program: A program the cleans files of the computer and moves them to cloud while deleting the physical copies on the computer drive. The program also includes a Report Manager which manages discrepencies between the DataBase and the Physical Hard Disk reports and gives the mismatches between appearances.

TODO:

Split the main manipulation method into several smaller methods for readability and for easier manipulation of the program itself. *-Done*

Make all the file paths an input and not hardcoded, also make all the user inputs to be taken care of in one place instead of all around the manipulation method.

Write explanation comments to make understanding the program easier +(After stage 1, readability preferred). *-Done*
